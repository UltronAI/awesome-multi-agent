This repo is used to record  algorithms for multi-agent scenarios, either about a complete system, or part of it. 

At present, **the multi-agent algorithms related to team confrontation** have received the most attention.

For each paper, we should answer the following questions:
- What **problems** does it solve?
- What **methods** does it propose?
- How are the **results**?
- What **challenges** or **deficiencies** does it face?
- **Where** is it published? **Who** are the authors?

In addition, some related resources, such as hyperlinks to open-source codes and PDF files, are also welcome.
